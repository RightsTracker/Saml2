TENANT IDS
==========

Each Tenant ID is a guid. These IDs grant authenticated access to RT License. 
As some of these point to Live accounts it is vital you keep the guid secret. 
The guid is used in the URL so it could be seen by someone e.g. watching your screen in a demo.
IF you think you might have accidently shown one then contact Jay to get it changed.


I have prepared Tenants for localhost development, Dev, Release, QA, and Live.
You can edit, or add new tenants, to localhost, Dev, and Release freely.
Please do not edit or add to QA and Live without checking with Jay first.


localhost
---------
Note: 
- You will need to use the "Local" setting in RTLicense
- You will need to be running a localhost copy of StubIdp from the Saml2 repository (this project)
